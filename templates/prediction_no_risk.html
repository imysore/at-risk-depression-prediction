    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Prediction: <strong class=relevant>No Risk</strong></h1>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The model predicts that you are at <strong class=relevant>no risk for depression.</strong></h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px;">However, please remember that mental health diagnosis is a <em>process</em> that requires a comprehensive assessment by qualified professionals.
      The predictions generated by this model are merely probabilistic and should <em>never be used to substitute a diagnosis.</em></p>
    <p>Note that it's still good to have some self-care practices in place even when things are going well. 
      If you have a few symptoms and notice that they don't improve, consider bringing them up with someone you trust.</p>
